# ML Foundation - SP-Recommendation-Algorithm

This is our student project for the Machine Learning Foundation course done by Pr. Fragkiskos Malliaros at Centrale Sup√©lec Paris, October - December 2019.

This is an attempt to create a recommendation algorithm that includes two user-set parameters: specificity and popularity of recommendation.

Specificity means how close to the user profile the suggestion will be (based on similar users' profiles).

Popularity is a threshold to avoid too popular titles and look for less seen series (based on several measures of popularity).

Our database is from MyAnimeList.net, a platform where ~300.000 users publicly rate and comment ~14.000 animated series called "Animes". Source data found on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/azathoth42/myanimelist
